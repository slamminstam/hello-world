I'm supposed to talk about myself here. I am a technology teacher who is trying to protect his activities.

I work for a company where I've developed activities for new hire training. They want to use these for a branch of training unrelated to my program. I am putting them here so I can prove they were done by me before anyone else can take credit for them.

Yay improvised proof-of-ownership!
